# Hop
A simple game where the player hops from platform to platform.

Platforms are represented by bars, and holes are represented by spaces. The player is assumed to be on the first platform!
Press F to do a short hop, to jump one unit forward, J to do a long hop, to jump two units forward!

The game is currently in Minimum Viable Produc mode, possible improvements are UI and look and feel, and bug fixes! (And probably decoupling the code!)

(Also probably move away from Swing 🏌️)
